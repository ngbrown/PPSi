@top Introduction

PPSi (@sc{ptp} Ported to Silicon) is an application which, in
its basic operation, implements @sc{ieee} 1588 specification in a way
that is portable to several architectures, including OS-less ones.

This manual is mainly aimed at developers: people who are working with
@sc{ptp} and/or White Rabbit and need to use the protocol in their own
hardware or software environments.  Users who simply run PPSi on the host
may want to read @ref{Command Line} and little else.


@c ##########################################################################
@node Project Overview
@chapter Project Overview

This project originates in the context of @i{White Rabbit}, which is
shortened to @i{WR} in this manual.

WR is a multi-lab research project that aims at synchronizing
thousands of I/O devices distributed in a network several kilometers
wide; its software protocol is an extension of @sc{ptp}.  A WR network is
made up of two devices: the @i{WR Switch} and the @i{WR Node}.  White
Rabbit is developed at ohwr.org:
@t{http://www.ohwr.org/projects/white-rabbit}.

The WR switch is an 18-ports Gigabit Ethernet switch that runs
@sc{wr-ptp} as a Linux process, synchronizing each Ethernet link as
either a @sc{ptp} master or a @sc{ptp} slave (it is a @i{boundary clock}). The
WR node is an I/O device that includes a soft core that runs @sc{wr-ptp}
in @i{freestanding} mode (i.e., without an operating system).

PPSi, as a software package, is designed to be the @sc{ptp}
implementation used in WR, running both standard @sc{ptp} and
@sc{wr-ptp}, in all possible use cases.

The algorithm and computation routines regarding the basic @sc{ieee} 1588
are derived from the @i{PTPd} project, v.2.1.0 (see AUTHORS for details
about copyright); but as of March 2013 very little remains of the original
code base.  In addition to the basic feature set we inherited from @i{PTPd},
we support raw Ethernet frames (@t{ETH_P_1588}), according to Annex F of the
specification and support for protocol extensions.

We thank Danilo Sabato for fixing the @i{bare} architectures
(see @ref{Architectures}).

@node Status Features and Bugs
@chapter Status, Features, Bugs

This document tries to summarize the status of
the project, but we are working a lot on the package,
so information here may be slightly out of date with respect to code.

The software package is designed to be modular: each of architectures,
protocols and timing engine
 can be replaced by providing a proper subdirectory.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Build-time Configuration
@section Build-time Configuration

After release 2013.11 we added to PPSi the Kconfig configuration
engine.  Configuration is now performed by running ``@t{make
menuconfig}'' or equivalent command.

A number of ready-to use configuration files are distributed in the
@t{configs/} directory: to use any of them name it as target of @i{make}
(for example: ``@t{make wrs_defconfig}'').

The default configuration is @i{unix_defconfig}, that builds a Unix daemon
running the standard @sc{ptp} version 2 protocol.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Architectures
@section Architectures

When building PPSi, the user can specify which architecture to build
for, by selecting it in @t{make menuconfig} or equivalent configuration
command.  When cross-compiling, you need to tell your cross-compiler
prefix in the configuration step, or override it at build time
by passing @t{CROSS_COMPILE=} on the commabnd line.

The package currently supports the following architectures:

@table @i

@item unix

	This is the default architecture and is the normal @i{hosted}
        environment.  The architecture is usually tested over the Linux
        kernel using the standard GNU libraries. Most of the code relies
        on standard @sc{posix} conventions, so this architecture most
        likely works on @sc{bsd} and other variants as well. We may
        change naming accordingly, after identifying the weak
        (i.e. unportable) points.  This architecture supports the standard
        protocol on both @sc{udp} and raw Ethernet, also both at the
        same time thanks to the per-link split of I/O methods.
        The architecture relies on @i{time-unix}, but it supports
        building with different time engines.

@item wrs

	The White Rabbit switch build of PPSi is designed to be a
        separate architecture, even if the switch itself is a Linux
        system running on an ARM processor.  The switch is a complex
        system, with several daemons cooperating through an IPC
        mechanism: the standard main loop for a standalone Unix daemon
        doesn't apply to the WR switch, and modelling it as a
        separate architecture is the simplest and cleanest approach,
        in our opinion (even if it leads to some code duplication).
        The architectures relies on @i{time-wrs}.

@item wrpc

	The @i{White Rabbit PTP Core} architecture is a port of PPSi to
        run on our I/O devices. The @i{wrpc} is a ``@i{core}'', i.e. a
        logic block, that runs in WR-capable I/O cards. Most such cards
        are developed as open hardware on @i{ohwr.org}; examples are
        the @sc{spec} (a PCIe carrier for FMC devices) and the @sc{svec}
        (a VME carrier, with two FMC slots driver by the same WR core).
        The @i{wrpc} includes a soft-core
        @sc{cpu} that runs the @sc{wr-ptp} daemon.  PPSi is designed to
        be able to be linked from @i{wrpc-sw} as its own @i{wr-ptp}
        engine. PPSi in this environment currently supports only raw
        Ethernet, not @sc{udp}.  The architecture uses @i{time-wrpc}.

@item sim

	This is a simulator. It uses special time and network operations
        to simulate a master and a slave exchanging ptp frames.
        Arch-specific configuration options are implemented in
        @i{arch-sim/sim-conf.c}. Use of the simulator is briefly
        descibed in @ref{Configuring the Simulator}.

@item bare-i386

	This architecture uses system calls towards the Linux kernel but
        does not rely on standard libraries.  The port only supports
        raw Ethernet frames and is thought to be a validation for our
        @i{freestanding} ports.  The process built as @i{bare-i386}
        runs on conventional x86 Linux hosts and demonstrates that
        PPSi works properly with no added dependencies on external
        libraries; freedom from dependencies is mandatory to retain
        the ability to build and run in @i{freestanding} environments
        like @i{wrpc} or microcontrollers.

@item bare-x86-64

	Like @i{bare-i386}, this architectures makes direct system calls
        without relying on external libraries. The host in this case is
        the a 64-bit PC instead of a 32-bit one. Both bare ports use
        @i{time-bare} for their timing operations.

@end table

We plan, over time, to support microcontrollers (a beta version for
ARM7 is working, and we are considering Cortex-M) and @i{bare-arm} (to
be tested on the WR switch).

@c ==========================================================================
@node Protocols
@section Protocols

At build time, the user can select the standard protocol (selected by
default by most architectures) or an extension.
The code base only includes one extension, White Rabbit, which is the
default choice when building for one of the WR architectures.
Nothing in PPSi
prevents our fellow developers to support their own @i{ptp} extension
using PPSi.

Each extension lives in a subdirectory called @t{proto-ext-}@i{name}.
Source files in that directory may override the implementation for the
standard protocol (which lives in @t{proto-standard}) to provide their
own functionalities.  To simplify writing extensions, the @i{proto-standard}
functions already provide @i{hooks} so the extension itself can provide
callbacks while still using the basic @sc{ptp} engine.
The set of callbacks is currently based on the needs of
WR, but we are willing to accept patches to provide more hooks as
needed.

If you plan to write your own protocol extension within PPSi, please
refer to how @i{proto-ext-whiterabbit} is implemented.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Time Functions and Network Operations
@section Time Functions and Network Operations

PPSi supports custom implementations of time functions, so you can
easily port the daemon to your own timing primitives.

The subdirectories named @i{time-sth} are used to implement timing
functions; timing includes the methods that are part of two data
structures: @i{pp_time_operations} and @i{pp_network_operations}.  The
former structure deals with getting and setting system time, while the
latter deals with frame tx and rx. Network operations are concerned
with timestamping the actual I/O, and that's why they are considered
part of the ``timing'' of PPSi.

Each architecture defines its own @t{TIME=} choice in the specific
@t{Makefile}.  The user can override the default by either setting the
variable on the command line of PPSi, or by setting an environment
variable if the architecture supports it.  For example, the @i{bare}
architectures force @t{TIME=bare}, while the @i{unix} architecture
suggests Unix timing code (@t{TIME?=unix}). The choice for @t{TIME=}
is not currently selected using Kconfig, because nobody is expected
to diverge from the default choice for the architecture being built.

If you want to support a different timing engine within the Unix build
system, you can use ``@t{make TIME=xyz}'' to request building
the @i{time-xyz} subdirectory.  Please note that the Unix time
structures are built anyways for @t{CONFIG_ARCH=unix},
so you can piggy-back on those
functions, either within your own methods or by replacing the
@t{ppi->t_ops} and @t{ppi->n_ops} for the communications links that do
not include your own hardware support.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Features
@section Features

This is a summary of current and planned features for the PPSi
package.  As said, we are working on it these months, so the following
list me be not up to date with software developments by the time you
read it.

The following list if features doesn't consider known bugs, which are
listed in the following sections. Please consider such bugs transient
mishaps, as we are working on them right now; anyways, it would be
unfair to hide them.

@table @r

@item Support standard @sc{ptp} and extensions.

	Each protocol extension should fall back to standard @sc{ptp} when
        it detects that its peers are not able to speak the extended
        protocol.  We don't plan to support more than one extensions in
        a single build: it would be just an academic exercise until
        somebody contributes a new protocol extension to PPSi.

@item Support both hosted and freestanding environments.

	This is already supported, though we still lack a microcontroller
        implementation, and our only freestanding environment is @i{wrpc},
        running on an LM32 processor.

@item Support multi-link operation.

	The daemon manages several links at the same time, being master
        slave or auto-detect independently on each link.
        The @i{best master clock} algorithm is run globally,
        but communication and timeouts are managed per-link.

@item Support both @sc{udp} and raw Ethernet.

	We already do that. We plan use the multi-link operation to
        support both @sc{udp} and raw Ethernet on the same network
	interface. Also, we expect to support @sc{udp} in the WR switch,
        to allow progressive and seamless migration to WR if you already
        support @sc{ptp} in your network with a @sc{udp}-only implementation.

@item Support fall-back master links.

	This is needed for WR, and is being worked on.
        We need to track more than one master in order to switch over
        from one to the other within a few milliseconds and with no
        time glitches.

@item Support hardware timestamping where available.

	This is not yet implemented for the generic protocol, but we
        plan to add at least @i{time-linux-tstamp} soon.

@item Support @sc{bsd} specifics.

	Unfortunately the @i{hosted} part of the packages is slightly
        too much Linux-dependent.  We plan to support the @sc{bsd}
        variants as well, hoping to get interest and patches from some
        @sc{bsd} developer.

@item Allow architectures to state their capabilities.

	Currently the command-line arguments are a an all-or-nothing thing.
        But, for example, @i{bare} architectures don't support
        @sc{udp} and other architectures may not support raw Ethernet.
        We plan to allow architectures to state their capabilities to
        report proper errors when the user tries to set up unimplemented
        configurations.

@item Support run-time enable/disable of diagnostics.

	We want to allow run-time modification of diagnostics flags
        with a per-link granularity.  Currently we have configuration-based
        per-link diagnostic flags and global flags that can be changed
        at run time (for example, arch-wrpc offers that through a shell
        command). We think this feature is useful
        when you run more than a pair of interfaces and have problems
	on some of the links but not all of them.

@node Bugs
@section Bugs

As of 2013-05 the project suffers from these known bugs:

@itemize
@item All frames must be sent according to a pseudo-random distribution;
      this is mostly in place but mut be audited project-wide.
@item We removed @i{peer-delay} support. We plan to add it back, and
      actually move White Rabbit to use @i{peer-delay} @sc{ptp} instead of
      @i{end-to-end} @sc{ptp}. 
@item The servo for standard-@sc{ptp} must be audited. We are doing
      it now using  @i{arch-sim} support,
@item @sc{udp} over @sc{IPV6} is not yet supported.
@end itemize

@c ##########################################################################
@node Configuration
@chapter Configuration

PPSi support configuration files and individual configuration items
passed on the command line.  Such support is currently not available
for freestanding architectures (the @i{bare} ones and @i{wrpc-sw}).

When PPSi starts it parses its own configuration. The command line can
include a number of @t{-f <file>} and @t{-C <item>} options; they are
processed in order, so later ones override earlier ones. A
configuration ``item'' can include several directives, using the
semicolon as a separator.

If no configuration file is specified, the program reads the default
one, which is architecture-specific (thus, the default configuration
file is processed after all the command line configuration items.  The
default file name is @t{/etc/ppsi.conf}, but @t{arch-wrs} tries to
load @t{/wr/etc/ppsi.conf} first.   The source tree of PPSi includes
two example configuration files in its own @t{etc/} subdirectory.

Configuration is made of of global options and port-specific options.
To configure a port, use @t{port <name>} followed by its options.
The parser allocates a new @sc{ptp} state machine for each new port, but
allows changing configuration of an existing port.  For instance, to
enable frame diagnostics for a specific port, you can use:

@smallexample
        ./ppsi -f /etc/ppsi.conf -C "port eth1; diagnostics 02"
@end smallexample

Each configuration item is made up of a keyword and an optional
argument.  The argument can be either a number or a string.  The
parser looks up keywords in three tables: a global table, an
architecture-specific table and an extension-specific table.
Currently, only @i{arch-sim} has specific configuration items.

The list of global configuration items is on show in @t{lib/conf.c},
as the @t{pp_global_arglines} array.   Future versions of this manual
may document the keywords, if the time allows it.

@b{Note:} most current command-line options are going to be turned into
configuration options. This applies to the priorities, intervals and
thresholds, as well as the @i{slave-only} flag.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Configuring the Simulator
@section Configuring the Simulator

To tun the PPSi simulator you need to rely on diagnostics and specific
configuration items.  The configuration items are defined in
@i{arch-sim/sim-conf.c} and are not individually documented here at
this point.

After building with ``@t{make sim_defconfig}'', you can look at how
PPSi behaves in different situation. For example, to see how the servo
works with default parameters you can activate servo messages at level
2, and only look at the offset from master:

@smallexample
   ./ppsi -d 0002 | grep 'Offset from master'
@end smallexample

The diagnostic values are specified in the range 0 to 2 and represent,
in this order: state machine, time, frames, servo, bmc, extensions.
See @ref{Diagnostic Macros} for details.

The simulator runs by default for one hour of simulated time (in a
fraction of a second of running time), and the initial offset from
master to slave is 0.9 seconds.

To pass configuration options, you can use the @t{-C} command line option.
so, for example, to start with 0.1 seconds of offset and 1000 ns of
transmission jitter, you can run like this:

@smallexample
   ./ppsi -d 0002 -C "sim_init_master_time .1; sim_jit_ns 1000"
@end smallexample


@c ##########################################################################
@node PTP Clock Class
@chapter PTP Clock Class

The clock class value (@t{clockClass}), a field of the ``clock quality''
structure, can be specified in the configuration file for the architectures
that support such a file.

For the White Rabbit node (@t{arch-wrpc}) the class is defined
according to build-time constants, set forth in @t{constants.h}.

When the node is configured as grandmaster (WRPC shell command @t{mode
gm}), the class is set to 6 (a clock synchronized to a primary
reference time source).  However, if the internal PLL can not lock in
a 60 seconds timeout, the class is set to 52: a clock that will never
be a slave, but is not currently connected to a primary time source.

When the node is configured as master, it uses class 187, i.e.
a clock that may be a slave of another clock.

@c ##########################################################################
@node Diagnostics
@chapter Diagnostics

During development of PPSi, diagnostic support used several
techniques, but finally we converged on the one described here, that
is here to stay.  The idea is that we need to add verbosity
per-feature and per-port.  This fine-grained control is expected to be
important while developing features or while diagnosing problems on
new architectures.

The @t{diagnostics} configuration keyword can be used both as a global
item and as a port-specific configuration value.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Diagnostic Macros
@section Diagnostic Macros

The header file @t{<ppsi/diag-macros.h>} introduces the concept of
diagnostics flags, which are hosted in both a global variable and
@i{pp_instance} (i.e. one flags-set for each communication link).  The
macros use the logical OR of both flags, so developers can activate
diagnostics on either a single link or globally.

The diagnostic flags are split into topics (called @i{things}). For
each diagnostic thing the header defines a few bits; so we can have
diagnostic levels for each of them, but we suggest only using level 1
and 2 -- the rationale is in the header itself.

The @i{things} currently defined are:

@itemize
@item Finite State Machine: PPSi reports FSM state transitions.

@item Time: at level 1 PPSi reports @i{time_set} operations
and timeouts; at level 2 it also reports @i{time_get} operations.

@item Frames: at level 1 PPSi reports any send and receive event; at level 2
it also shows the frame itself (using @i{ptpdump} code).

@item Servo: report servo operation. At level 2 it also shows the individual
timestamps and internal averaging.

@item BMC: at level 1 PPSi reports BMC choices, at level 2 it reports
addition of new masters as well.

@item Extensions: extension-specific information.

@item Configuration: at level 1 PPSi reports errors, at level 2 all
configuration items being parsed (from either files or command line).

@end itemize

The user is expected to pass diagnostic flags as a string,
specifying diagnostic levels for each of the things, where trailing
zeroes are optional.  So for example ``@t{01}'' specifies a
diagnostic level 1 for time, and ``@t{102}'' specifies FSM at level 1
and frames at level 2.   The header itself is more detailed about
the conventions.

To parse the diagnostic string, PPSi offers @i{pp_diag_parse}.  The
function is used by both the code that reads the command line
and code that parses configuration.

Within PPSi, developers should insert diagnostic messages by means
of the @i{pp_diag} function:

@example
   pp_diag(ppi, thing, level, ...)
@end example

The function acts like @i{printf}, with the leading arguments @t{ppi},
@t{thing} (which is one of the names fsm, time, frames, servo, bmc,
ext) and @t{level}, which should be 1 or 2. For example, the code
setting system time includes this diagnostic line:

@example
    pp_diag(ppi, time, 1, "%s: %9li.%09li\n", __func__,
            tp.tv_sec, tp.tv_nsec);
@end example

Finally, if you need to shrink the size of your binary file, you can
build PPSi with no diagnostic code at all (i.e., the compiler won't
even generate the function calls), you can define @t{PPSI_NO_DIAG} in
@t{CFLAGS} while building.  This can be achieved by setting
@t{USER_CFLAGS}:

@example
   make USER_CFLAGS="-DPPSI_NO_DIAG"
@end example

For more details please refer to the header file, which is throughly
commented.


@c ==========================================================================
@node Older Diagnostics
@section Older Diagnostics

We introduced the diagnostic macros described above at the beginning
of March 2013.  Earlier code used a less-structured approach, which 
has later been removed. If you used @t{PP_PRINTF}, it's gone by now.

@c ==========================================================================
@node Printf
@section Printf

The code uses @i{pp_printf} as a replacement for @i{printf}.  This
implementation comes from previous work by Alessandro, which in turn
uses an older Linux implementation.  Now @i{pp_printf} is published
separately, as the ``Poor Programmer's Printf'' and included here
in its own subdirectory.  Please check @i{pp_printf/README} for more
details about the size of this implementation and the different
implementation choices.

By avoiding calls to the real @i{printf} function we allow the PPSi
code base to be built for freestanding implementations without ugly
@t{#ifdef} tricks in the code.  Please note that @i{pp_printf} and
@i{printf} can coexist: for example the hosted version of PPSi links
with the standard library without any problem; in that case
@i{pp_printf} relies on @i{fputs} to write to @i{stdout}.

If your run-time environment already includes an implementation
of @i{pp_printf}, you can build with @t{CONFIG_NO_PRINTF} set. For
example:

@example
   make USER_CFLAGS="-DCONFIG_NO_PRINTF"
@end example

The resulting @t{ppsi.o} will include undefined references to the
@t{pp_printf} symbol, which must be provided externally.  This is how
we build for @i{arch-wrpc}, which already includes its own
implementation if @i{pp_printf}.  In that specific situation we still
link the @i{libc} provided by the compiler, but we don't want to lift
its own @i{printf} which would bring in most of @i{newlib} and would
overflow our available RAM by a huge amount.

If your freestanding environment provides a @i{printf} that you want
to use, and which is not called @i{pp_printf}, you may use the
@t{PROVIDE} keyword in your linker script.  You can find an example in
the @i{wrpc-sw} package, which maps @i{mprintf} to @i{pp_printf} at
link time, in order to accept external code that calls @i{mprintf},
which we don't provide any more.

@c ##########################################################################
@node Tools
@chapter Tools

The PPSi package includes some tools, mainly meant to help developers.
Most of them live in the @i{tools} subdirectory and must be built
separately with ``@t{make -C tools}''.

@c ==========================================================================
@node ptpdump
@section ptpdump

This is a sniffer for @sc{ptp} frames. It reports all Ethernet frames and
UDP datagrams that talk @sc{ptp}, from a specific network interface. The
output format is line-oriented to help running @i{grep} over log
files.  The number of blank lines between frames depends on how much
time elapsed between them; this should help identifying sync/follow-up
pairs at a glimpse of the eye.

The program receives one optional argument on the command line, which is
the name of the interface where it should listen; by default it uses @t{eth0}.

This is, for example, the dump of two UDP frames:

@smallexample

@c ==========================================================================
@node pps-out
@section pps-out

The tool outputs a pulse-per-second signal to a parallel port or a
serial port.  Most likely it only works on an x86 Linux system because
of direct access to I/O ports -- no such portability problem is
expected for serial ports.  For this reason it is not built by
default in the distributed @t{tools/Makefile}

The program receives a single argument on the command line, which is
either an hex port number (with or without leading @t{0x}) or an
absolute filename:

@example
   ./tools/pps-out 378
   ./tools/pps-out /dev/ttyS0
@end example

When passed a port number, the program toggles all bits assuming it
refers to a parallel port.  When passed a pathname, the program assumes
it is a serial port and it toggles the DTR and RTS modem control signals
(on pins 4 and 7 of the DB9 male connector).

By setting the @t{VERBOSE} environment variable you ask the program
to report how late it was before and after generating the rising
edge:

@example
   morgana$ VERBOSE=1 ./tools/pps-out /dev/ttyS0
  gettimeofday takes 0.2 usec
  udelay takes 4.0 usec
  delayed between   0 and   2 usecs
  delayed between   0 and   4 usecs
  [...]
@end example

@t{pps-out} can be used to verify on a scope the level of
synchronization of two or more computers, but please note that the
user-space software-only approach shows some jitter; on my systems the
delay is usually a few microseconds, up to around a dozen (in general,
use of the parallel port has less delay and less jitter). In any case
this offers a second source to check what NTP or @sc{ptp} daemons report.

@c ==========================================================================
@node jmptime
@section jmptime

The program uses @i{settimeofday} to make the local time jump forward
or backward by some amount, specified as floating-point seconds:

@example
   # date +%H:%M:%S; ./tools/jmptime 1.32; date +%H:%M:%S
   12:24:28
   Requesting time-jump: 1.320000 seconds
   12:24:29
@end example

@c ==========================================================================
@node chktime
@section chktime

This program monitors changes in the current time, but comparing the
output of @t{clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME)} and
@t{clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)}.  The delay between successive
checks, expressed in milliseconds, can be specified on the command
line and defaults to 10ms.  The program only reports observed changes
that are bigger than 0.5ms, to avoid excessive reporting of false
positives that are simply due to process latencies induced by the
system workload.

By running this program you can see the effect of @i{tools/jmptime},
or the insertion of a leap second (which is why I wrote this program
in June 2012).  

For example, this is what @i{chktime} reports when running
``@t{jmptime .002}''. The program doesn't need superuser privileges:

@example
   % ./tools/chktime 50
   ./tools/chktime: looping every 50 millisecs
   13-03-12-12:29:41:       1996 us
@end example

@c ==========================================================================
@node adjtime
@section adjtime

This program works like @i{jmptime}, but it requests a slow adjustment
of the time. It receives the requested adjustment on the command
line, as a floating point number just like @i{jmptime} described
above.  Additionally, it reports what was the ongoing adjustment
using @i{adjtime}. See the @t{adjtime(2)} man page for details.

Adjustments requested by this program cannot be reported by
@i{tools/chktime}, even when the overall change integrates to more
than half a millisecond, because the change in clock speed affects
both @t{CLOCK_REALTIME} and @t{CLOCK_MONOTONIC}.

You can see adjustment in one host by comparing with the time of another
host, for example using @i{tools/mtp}, described next.

The following example shows how on my host the kernel adjusts the time by
15ms every 30s (i.e. 0.05%):

@example
   # ./tools/adjtime .15; sleep 30; ./tools/adjtime 0
   Requesting adjustment: 0.150000 seconds
   Previous adjustment: 0.000000 seconds
   Requesting adjustment: 0.000000 seconds
   Previous adjustment: 0.135000 seconds
@end example

@c ==========================================================================
@node adjrate
@section adjrate

The program reads and optionally changes the clock rate of the host
system using the Linux-specific @i{adjtimex} system call (the same
being used in the core PPSi program).  It is meant to check adjustment
and get acquainted with the involved values.

The numerical argument of the system call is parts-per-million scaled
by 16 bits. So for example half @i{ppm} is passed as 32768.

The following are example uses of the program on an ntp-driven host:

@example
   morgana% ./tools/adjrate --help
   ./tools/adjrate: use "./tools/adjrate [<adj-value> [ppm]]"
   morgana% ./tools/adjrate
   rate: -407582 (-6.219208 ppm)
   morgana% ./tools/adjrate -6
   ./tools/adjrate: adjtimex(rate=-6): -1 (Operation not permitted)
   morgana% sudo ./tools/adjrate -6 ppm
   morgana% sudo ./tools/adjrate
   rate: -393216 (-6.000000 ppm)
@end example

@c ==========================================================================
@node mtp
@section mtp

The directory @i{tools/mtp} includes a few example programs I wrote for
an article about time synchronization. MTP means ``mini time protocol'';
it uses the T1, T2, T3, T4 idea to report the time difference between
two hosts.  The program comes in two flavors: UDP and raw Ethernet.

To run a listening server on one host, you can run the program in
@i{listen} mode:

@example
   tornado% ./tools/mtp/mtp_udp -l
@end example

On the other host, you can run the client that reports the time
difference it measures, you can pass either an IP address or an host
name:

@example
  morgana% ./tools/mtp/mtp_udp tornado
  0: rtt  0.000459000   delta   0.099351500
@end example

You can continuously monitor the difference by running the program in a
loop:

@example
   morgana% while true; do ./tools/mtp/mtp_udp tornado; sleep 0.1; done
@end example

The program @i{mtp_packet} works in the same way by using raw Ethernet
frames (@t{AF_PACKET}). It needs an interface name as first argument
and superuser privileges.

@c ==========================================================================
@node MAKEALL
@section MAKEALL

The @i{MAKEALL} script, in the top-level directory of PPSi builds the
program for all known configurations, picking them from @t{configs/}.
Developers are urged to run it
before committing each patch, to ensure they are not breaking the
program for configurations they are not using -- but sometimes I
forgot to do that myself and committed trivially-incomplete changes.

It may happen, however, that some developers experience errors or
warnings that others didn't notice, because of differences in compiler
version or library versions.

What follows is an older example run, limited to hosted compilation;
currently, with the new Kconfig engine introduced after release
2013.11, @t{MAKEALL} ignores command-line arguments and always builds
all configurations; but I plan to add the command line back.

@example
   % ./MAKEALL unix
   ###### Build for  arch "unix", ext "", printf xint
      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
     15801     224     344   16369    3ff1 ppsi.o
     34370     984     380   35734    8b96 ppsi
   ###### Build for  arch "unix", ext "", all messages
      text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
     16850     224     344   17418    440a ppsi.o
     35410     984     380   36774    8fa6 ppsi
@end example

@node Build Details
@chapter Build Details

This is a summary about the build process for PPSi.

The main @i{Makefile} creates directory names from @t{$ARCH} and @t{$PROTO_EXT},
each sub-@i{Makefile} then can augment @t{CFLAGS} with "@t{-ffreestanding}" or
whatever it needs. Similarly, @t{CROSS_COMPILE} may be set by sub-Makefiles
but please let the environment override it (as no custom pathnames
should be edited before building and the pristine package can be used).

The basic state machine is in @i{./fsm.c}. It's a simple file released in
the public domain as we'd like the idea to be reused and the code
itself is not worth copylefting -- even thought the file is not completely
independent from PPSi itself.

All the rest of the package is built as libraries. The link order
of libraries selects which object files are picked up and which are not.
Additionally, "@t{CONFIG_PRINTF_XINT}" or one of the other @i{pp_printf}
configurations can be set to override the default. By default PPSi
builds the ``full'' implementation.

This state-machine source refers to a specific state machine by the
name @i{pp_state_table}.  The table is picked from a
library: either from the extension being selected or the @i{proto-standard} one.
The table includes pointers to functions, and such names
will select which other object files are picked up from the libraries.

Individual architectures can add files to the "@t{OBJ-y}" make variable,
in order to add their own stuff (like the @i{main} function or @i{crt0.o}
for freestanding stuff).  Similarly, architectures can add files
to the "all" target. The main Makefile only builds @i{ppsi.o},
leaving the final link to the chosen architecture, so for example
@i{arch-unix} adds @t{ppsi} to the @t{all} target.

Since code and data space is a problem in the freestanding world (for
example, the whole ptp may need to fit in 64kB RAM including data and
stack), each state in the state machine of the standard protocol must
be implemented as a separate file. This allows an extension not using
that particular function to save the overhead of binary size.
Clearly an extension may implement several functions in the same file,
if they are known to be all used in the final binary or of it uses
@t{-ffunction-sections} and @t{-fdata-sections}).


@c ##########################################################################
@node Licensing
@chapter Licensing

The code is licensed according to the GNU LGPL, version 2.1 or later.
Some files are individually released to the public domain, when we
think they are especially simple or generic.

Both the full and the partial printf code is distributed according to
the GPL-2, as it comes from the Linux kernel.  This means that any
code using our diagnostics fall under the GPL requirements; you may
compile and use the diagnostic code internally with your own
proprietary code but you can't distribute binaries with diagnostics
without the complete source code and associated rights. You may avoid
the GPL requirements by using different printf implementations; if so
we'd love to have them contributed back in the package.

The same issue about the GPL license applies to the @i{div64_32}
function.  We need this implementation in our @i{wrpc} code base
because the default @i{libgcc} division is very big, and we are always
tight with our in-FPGA memory space.

For binaries without diagnostic code and the size-optimized division,
the LGPL applies, as detailed below.

For licensing purposes, any `arch-name' or `time-name' subdirectory
"can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves" (quoting the LPGL text).

Code in the directories provided here is all LGPL, and
you may add your own drop-in subdirectories. The LGPL requirements for
source distribution and associated permissions won't apply to any such
subdirectory that you may add, even if technically such code is not
linked as a library.

@node Coding Style and Conventions
@chapter Coding Style and Conventions

The coding style is the one inherited from Linux kernel project (see
@i{Documentation/CodingStyle} in the kernel sources).  However,
structures, constants and field names defined by @sc{ieee} 1588 are kept in
the suggested "CamelCase" form. Similarly, the typedefs are left, even
if they are really a pain to deal with.  Most of this stuff is in
include/ppsi/ieee1588_types.h file.

The mostly used prefix is @t{pp_}, the short prefix for 'Portable @sc{ptp}',
which is used for every function related to the algorithm itself (but
not in the architecture-specific code).

Some prefixes to the @sc{ieee} naming are added, in order to improve
readability:

@t{EN} means "enumeration type". For instance, Enumeration Time Source
(defined in the spec at table 7, page 57) becomes @t{ENTimeSource}.

@t{PPM_} means "ppsi message", and is used for message types.

@t{Msg} means "message" and is used for message structures.

@t{PPS_} means "ppsi state" and is used for state machine's states
definition.

@t{DS} means "data set", and is used for the standard Data Sets (e.g.
@i{DSCurrent} is the "Current Data Set"). The concept of data sets is
defined in the specification at chapter 8, page 63.

@c ##########################################################################
@node Command Line
@chapter Command Line

The hosted build, as well as the two @i{bare} ones, include command
line support.

The command:

@example
     ./ppsi --help
@end example

will print help about command line options (we also support the
question-mark like the original ptp, but it's a bad choice because it
is a shell wildcard that should be escaped).  Actually, all multi-char
options will print the help at this point in time, because we only
support since-char options; we don't want to rely on @i{getopt} which
is not available for all architectures, nor we want to implement
complex parsing.

@b{Note:} most current command-line options are going to be turned into
configuration options. This applies to the priorities, intervals and
thresholds, as well as the @i{slave-only} flag.

For standard operation, simply run @t{./ppsi} with no options. It will
work like the PTPd executable, with the automatic choice of
master/slave defined in @sc{ieee} specification (announce/timeout mechanism).

What follows is a list of the most important command line options. For
a list of the other ones please see the help message.

@table @t

@item -f <file>

	Read configuration file. The program can read several
        configuration files. If no @t{-f} is passed, it tries to
        read a configuration file from the standard places:
        @t{/wr/etc/ppsi.conf} if White Rabbit, and @t{/etc/ppsi.conf}.

@item -C <config-item>

	Pass a single configuration item, or several of them using
        the semicolon as separator. See @ref{Configuration} for details.

@item -d

	Diagnostics. This options receives the string of diagnostic
        levels for  fsm, time, frames, servo, bmc, extension (in that order).
        See @ref{Diagnostic Macros} for details.

@item -b <ifname>

	Specify which interface to use, for Ethernet mode (default:
        architecture-dependent, but @t{eth0} for Linux builds). This
        option can only be used in single-port operation.

@item -e

	Run in Ethernet mode (by default PPSi uses UDP if the architecture
        supports it).

@item -g

	Run as slave only.
